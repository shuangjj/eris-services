This app takes an image via its only endpoint, asks the Google Cloud Vision API for three descriptions of the image, and compares those descriptions to a chosen list of words. If there is a match, the image is added to the toadserver. This is a WIP, experimental, and probably full of bugs.

The goal is to incentivize the submission of content in a way that is self-organizing by rewarding accurate submissions.
